## What is Unrevealed?

[Unrevealed](https://unrevealed.tech) is a workflow based feature management solution that makes developing, testing and releasing features a smooth ride.

We're taking a whole new approach to feature flags, and strive to give you the best developer experience possible in the process.

## Why another tool?

There are tons of feature flag solutions out there. Some simpler than others, some open source, some completely home made... But whatever you've seen before only provides feature flags as an abstract concept, making it your responsibility to configure them well enough for your use case.

Unrevealed takes the opposite approach by solving concrete problems, like doing QA or running a private beta. And because Unrevealed is based on a 100% customizable worflow, you don't lose any of the flexibility.
